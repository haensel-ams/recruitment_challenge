Here is a small example dataset (csv file) with 10k records. The target variable is **Price**.
You have 7 attributes and obviously we want you to build some initial ML model which predicts 
the prices.

Here how the dataset looks: 

loc1,loc2,para1,dow,para2,para3,para4,price

0,01,1,Mon,662,3000.0,3.8,73.49

9,99,1,Thu,340,2760.0,9.2,300.0

0,04,0,Mon,16,2700.0,3.0,130.0

4,40,1,Mon,17,12320.0,6.4,365.0


### 1. Make some initial data analysis, which will hint to some stuctures in the data and how attributes are connected.

### 2. Fit some ML model(s) and explain briefly your choices.

### 3. Show with some X-validation the power of your model and comment the results.

### 4. Present us the results and the steps you have taken and also with some critical thinking and next steps.

* well commented and easy to follow code
* PDF (max 3 pages) with brief steps taken and results (incl. intermediates)


# Please use Python for your solution.
