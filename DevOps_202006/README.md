# DevOps/Data Engineer Challenge
This challenge will test your understanding and ability to combine and use some of the technologies
we are using in our systems

## Task
Build a flask server with the following pages:
* Index page
* Uploader page where you can upload a file SMALLER THAN 1MB to an 
api

The API is hosted at https://patw1h5276.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/upload and accepts 
POST requests only at the specified URL.

The server must manage checking the file size and only send it if it's smaller than 1MB.

## Hints

Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/

## Deliverable

A flask server that can send files to the API 
 

## Good luck and we are very excited to see your solutions! 
The next step in the interview process is then a personal meeting at our office.

## Note: We don't expect you to build THE perfect solution.
Our goal here is:
* See how you approach such a problem
* Get an idea of your programming skills and tools you can use
